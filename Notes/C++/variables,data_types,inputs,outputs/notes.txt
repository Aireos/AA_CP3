Alexander Anderson, Variables, Data Types, Inputs and Outputs notes

How are static and dynamically typed variables different?
static: is decalred and fixed at compile time
dynamically: data type is determined at run time based on its value

REMINDER: What is the difference between instantiating and declaring a variable?
instantiating: making the variable
declaring: defining the value of the variable

What are all the data types,number of bytes they take,and the things they include?
short|2bytes|-32,768-32,768
int       |4bytes|-26-26
long      |4bytes|-26-26
longlong  |8bytes|big #'s
floats    |4bytes|3.4E38
doubles   |8bytes|1.7E308
longdouble|8bytes|3.4E932
bool      |1bytes|true/false
char      |1bytes|single letter

What case type should be used for c++ variables?
snake case

What is the C++ standard library?
Repository of all of the addons that make running your code easier

How do you access the standard library?
#include <specific library name>

How do you create an output in C++?
std::cout << variable;

How do you create an input in C++?
cout << "Tell me your age: ";
int age;
cin >> age;

What is the stream in C++?
a object-orianted abstraction

What is a constant?
a variable we can not change the value or type of

Why do we write constants?
so that we don't accidently change a variable we do not want to change
